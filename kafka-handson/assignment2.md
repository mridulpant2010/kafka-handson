🔥 Good ask — this is exactly the kind of thing that tests **real engineering chops**, not just “I can produce/consume a message.”

Below is a set of **medium to hard Kafka scenarios**, all implementable in **kafka-python** (or confluent-kafka-python if you prefer better performance), designed to test **design, robustness, and production-readiness** — the things *senior engineers get grilled on*.

## 🧪 **1. Idempotent Producer with Retry & Backoff**

Write a producer that:

* Ensures exactly-once semantics (idempotent producer enabled)
* Retries with exponential backoff on transient errors
* Logs permanent errors to a DLQ topic

What it tests: producer config tuning, error handling, DLQ pattern

---

## 🧪 **2. Consumer Group Rebalance Handling**

Write a consumer that:

* Subscribes as part of a group
* Prints its assigned partitions when it joins
* Gracefully shuts down and commits offsets if it’s being revoked during a rebalance

What it tests: cooperative rebalancing, partition assignment callbacks

---

## 🧪 **3. Schema Evolution Handling**

Write a producer/consumer that:

* Uses Avro (or JSON schema if Avro is not set up)
* Publishes events with evolving schema (add/remove fields)
* Consumer gracefully ignores unknown fields and warns about missing required ones

What it tests: versioning, forward/backward compatibility

---

## 🧪 **4. Simulated Event-Time Windowing**

Write a consumer that:

* Buffers messages into event-time-based 5-minute windows
* At the end of each window, writes aggregated metrics (e.g., count, sum)

What it tests: understanding of stream-time vs processing-time, buffering logic

---

## 🧪 **5. High-Volume Partitioned Topic Producer**

Write a producer that:

* Sends 1 million events partitioned deterministically by a `user_id`
* Ensures even distribution across partitions
* Measures and logs throughput (messages/sec)

What it tests: partitioning keys, performance

---

## 🧪 **6. Consumer Lag Monitor**

Write a consumer that:

* Reads from a topic
* Tracks the lag per partition in real-time
* Sends an alert (just print/log) if lag > threshold

What it tests: offset management, lag tracking

---

## 🧪 **7. Dead Letter Queue Consumer**

Write a consumer that:

* Reads from a main topic
* Fails messages randomly (simulate deserialization errors)
* Sends failed messages to a `topic_dlq` with the original payload + error

What it tests: error routing, DLQ pattern

---

## 🧪 **8. Exactly-Once Processing with Manual Offset Commit**

Write a consumer that:

* Reads from topic
* Writes to a simulated DB
* Commits offsets only *after* successful DB write

What it tests: at-least-once vs exactly-once reasoning

---

## 🧪 **9. Multi-Topic Fan-In**

Write a consumer that:

* Subscribes to two topics: `user_events` and `payment_events`
* Merges streams into a single enriched event (join on user\_id)
* Publishes to `enriched_events`

What it tests: multi-topic, join semantics, buffering

---

## 🧪 **10. Throughput and Latency Benchmark**

Write a producer & consumer pair that:

* Sends 10 million events to a topic
* Measures producer throughput
* Consumer calculates end-to-end latency per message (using timestamp fields)

What it tests: benchmarking, measurement

---

# 🏆 Tips

✅ Use `acks=all`, `enable_idempotence=True` for producers where needed
✅ Use `auto.offset.reset='earliest'` in consumers for first runs
✅ Use callbacks (`on_assign`, `on_revoke`) to handle group rebalance
✅ Use compression (`snappy`, `lz4`) for high throughput
